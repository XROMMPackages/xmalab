The installer projects requires VS2013 and the extension Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Installer Projects (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=UnniRavindranathan-MSFT.MicrosoftVisualStudio2013InstallerProjects)
It also assumes that the xmalab was built in a build folder in the root folder of the repositort, e.g. xmalab/build. It also assumes that all the required dlls are in xmalab/build/bin/Release. It also assumes OpenCV version 2.4.13. In case the folder structure differs or another version of OpenCV is used please adjust xmalab_installer_generator/xmalab_installer_generator.vdproj accordingly. The final installer can be found in xmalab_installer_generator/Release/XMALab_setup.msi
Also if you build another version make sure to adjust the Version in the Properties window (View->Other Windows->PropertiesToolbar) of the project (xmalab_installer_generator).
Adjust the name of the installer manually for Beta number and make sure to change the upgrade code when building.
