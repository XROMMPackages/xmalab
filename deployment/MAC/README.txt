The scripts assume that xmalab was built in the xmalab/build folder. To build the app just run the build.sh script, e.g. from the xmalab folder ‘sh deployment/MAC/build.sh’.

To build the dmg just run ‘sh deployment/MAC/createDMG.sh VERSIONNUMBER’ with VERSIONNUMBER being the version.

The final dmg can be found in xmalab/build/bin
