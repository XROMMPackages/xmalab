XMALab is new software for marker-based XMA and XROMM. The developer is Dr. Ben Knorlein, a computer-vision expert and software engineer at the Center for Computation and Visualization at Brown University.

XMALab integrates distortion correction, calibration, marker tracking, rigid body calculations and filtering all into one program. XMALab replaces all
components of the MATLAB X-ray Project workflow. For marker-based XROMM, XMALab generates animation matrices suitable for animating bones in Autodesk Maya.
