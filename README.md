XMA Lab is new software for marker-based XMA and XROMM. The developer is Dr. Ben Knorlein, a computer-vision expert and software engineer at the Center for Computation and Visualization at Brown University.

XMA Lab integrates distortion correction, calibration, marker tracking, rigid body calculations and filtering all into one program. XMA Lab replaces all
components of the MATLAB X-ray Project workflow. For marker-based XROMM, XMA Lab generates animation matrices suitable for animating bones in Autodesk Maya.

XMA Lab development is supported by the US National Science Foundation through an Advances in Biological Informatics grant to PI Elizabeth Brainerd and 
CoPIs Stephen Gatesy and David Baier.
