XMALab is software for marker-based fluoromicrometry and XROMM, with tools for standard (non-X-ray) video analysis as well. The developer is Dr. Ben Knorlein, a computer-vision expert and software engineer at the Center for Computation and Visualization at Brown University. XMALab has been described and validated in [a peer-reviewed paper ](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/early/2016/09/21/jeb.145383) in the *Journal of Experimental Biology*. Publications using XMALab must provide attribution by citing: Kn≈°rlein, B.J., Baier, D.B., Gatesy, S.M., Laurence-Chasen, J.D. and Brainerd, E.L. 2016. Validation of XMALab software for marker-based XROMM. Journal of Experimental Biology, 219: 3701-3711. doi:10.1242/jeb.145383.

XMALab integrates distortion correction, calibration, marker tracking, rigid body calculations and filtering all into one program. XMALab replaces all
components of the MATLAB X-ray Project workflow. For marker-based XROMM, XMALab generates animation matrices suitable for animating bones in Autodesk Maya. XMALab also includes tools, such as checkerboard calibration, for motion analysis with standard (non-Xray) video.
